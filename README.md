# NLP-tone-classifier
A binary classifier on sequential data (50000 positive/negative IMDB reviews) using hidden Markov model (HMM) with Expectation Maximization algorithm.

Both HMM and EM are built from scratch with helps from reading [vrjkmr](https://github.com/vrjkmr/hmm/blob/master/hmm.py), [ducanhnguyen](https://github.com/ducanhnguyen/hidden-markov-model/blob/master/src/hmmd.py) and [Daniel Jurafsky & James H. Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/A.pdf).
